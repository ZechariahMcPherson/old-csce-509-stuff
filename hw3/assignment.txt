1) Write a short program named 3_1.py (less than 10 lines)
  that imports only urlopen and BeautifulSoup  and then builds a
  list of all links (<a> tag). Then it should process the list one
  element at a time and print the link. Use the URL https://cse.sc.edu/ .
  Finally it should print a count of the number of links.

2) Modify the previous program to obatin 3_2.py that
  a) write to the file "allLinks.txt"
  b) write only the URL, i.e. the value of the href

3) Run 5-getAllExternalLinks.py from chapter 3 on the URL https://cse.sc.edu/ .
  Modify the code to handle the exceptions that occur,  by logging,
  then ignoring and continuing to handle the other links.

4) Modify 5-getAllExternalLinks.py to check the website 5-getAllExternalLinks.py
